# OctoCue Companion module - help file

This module allows companion to receive live data from, and send commands to OctoCue.

Version 1 of this module will focus on countdown clock control only, with presenter control and slide clicking coming in future versions.

The module communicates with the installed OctoCue Receiver application running on the PowerPoint machine.

The module communicates using the OSC protocol - for details of OctoCue's OSC interface, see https://support.octocue.com/receiver/osc.

**Note that you'll need OctoCue Receiver v1.5 or later to allow for OSC control.**

Full details of OctoCue can be found at https://octocue.com.
